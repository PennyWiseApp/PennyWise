It was six men from Indostan,
to learning much inclined,
that went to see the elephant,
though all of them were blind,
that each by observation,
might satisfy his mind.

The first approached the elephant,
and happening to fall,
against its strong and sturdy side,
at once began to bawl,
"I see" quoth he, "the elephant
is very like a wall".

The second feeling of the tusk,
cried "Ho! What have we here?
'Tis very round and smooth and sharp
to me 'Tis mighty clear,
this marvel of an elephant
is very like a spear".

The third approached the animal,
and happening to take,
the squirming trunk within his hands
thus boldly up and spake,
"I see" quoth he "the elephant is 
very like a snake".

George got bored with poetry.
