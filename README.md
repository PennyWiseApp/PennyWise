It was six men from Indostan,
to learning much inclined,
that went to see the elephant,
though all of them were blind,
that each by observation,
might satisfy his mind.

The first approached the elephant,
and happening to fall,
against its strong and sturdy side,
at once began to bawl,
"I see" quoth he, "the elephant
is very like a wall".
