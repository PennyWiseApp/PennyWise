### Pre-script

Client was asked the following question:
> What do you currently use (if any) to keep track of prescriptions to be picked up or renewed?

User stated, currently the process of prescription admin is chaotic due to an insuffecient method of organisation. The calendar app is used to set the date and times for prescription ordering, pick ups and renewals. The user also needs to remember to set the dates for future meds, which is a hassle and wishes this whole process to be automated by just putting in the information once.
